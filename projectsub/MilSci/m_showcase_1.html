<h3> Inaugural Post | 03-Feb-2016</h3>
<p>This will be the first post in the military history / militry science section. At the time I think this will be a section for topics related to real and simulated conflicts. I am not sure as to how this section and my Youtube channel will interact however. I might decide to post some interesting sections of analysis, AARs, and reviews. Later on I wanted to talk a bit about a simulation project I have in mind. I thought it'd be neat to simulate communications during tactical conflicts. In practicse, this will be an excirse in communication. I want to explore this area of being able to direct troops, recieve information, and relay channels effectively. The idea came from the fact that almost all games do not simulate this area to great depth and I thought it would be interesting to explore it further.

<p> So all in all this is pretty vauge so let's put this into an example. Firstly, the goal of this simulation is not to develop a plan of action and to react to  it. From a design point of view this greatly simpifies the concerns the simulation framework and scenario deisgn's tasks. Taking from movie inspiration, let's talk about the first section of Black Hawk Down where the fireteams are inserted around this urban block. Four teams are outside in the corners securing movement around and into the building block while, to the best of my knowledge, one team goes in to capture personnel. In this situation if one where to map the possible situations that may arise and develop responses the question goes to where and when do we switch our plan of action? So this is where I believe this excirse is valuab0le.
