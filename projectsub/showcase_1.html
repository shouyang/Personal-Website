<h3> Webpage Project Start | 01-Feb-2016</h3>
<p style = "text-align: left;"> 
I suppose this will be the first formal posting on my projects page. Overall this website in its state as of 01-Feb-2016 is made within only 24 hours with much of the time spent on real life matters. It's very interesting to see the blend of html, css, and jquery at work. As you might imagine, most of not all of the content is made in html.

Overall the pages main and documents were the easiest to build. Following that, I decided to tackle the challenge of building up the Resume page. My resume translates pretty well into the format presented here however there were a few issues. For one, the alignment of a single line of text that has both right and left alignment. Secondly, in effort to present a mobile accessible site, some elements namely titles of positions, where originally set to a certain font size but then adjusted. For the styling presented here, I took the colour scheme from Financial Times. Oddly enough they had a web style guide availible to the public with the colour scheme for the site. They had fonts too, personally I find Garamond the best easy to view compact font so I decided against their selection in favor of my own. Of note, some sites show low font compatability with OSx I'll have to look into that.

I found designing this projects section especially interesting. In the future I hope to make this area more-so blog like but for now, this will do. The idea is that this particular section should pull information off other pages rather being quite a lengthly html doc. So using the jQuery AJAX functionaliy, this part of the site semi-dynamically loads these showcase sections. That said, this Webpage Project Start page is going to be in a seperate file than say the rest of projects.html

Leaving off, here is a picture to see how well this pulls through to projects.
