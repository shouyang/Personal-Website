<h3> Website Code Visualized | 03-Feb-2016</h3>
<p>I thought it'd be a cool experiement to make a visual of the html code for this website here and now for comparison later on. Even by its self it is interesting to not the differences in the chart between the different sections. Some of you may recognize where the images come from. They are the little sidemap from Sublime 2 a text editor. I've got to say, it is quite nice.

<p> I find the visual difference between index,resume, and channel. Overall index, documents, and projects are largely modularized. To that, in these sections you'll find the odd recurring spikes which pull information from smaller html files. The resume section is the one that needed the most work. Simply said, formatting the text into lists, left and right alignment on a single line and other bits and pieces take a lot of lines. Originally I think there were over 300 lines there, from that I shrunk it down to 200 at the cost of readability. I will probably expand this section later on. Lastly the channels page has very little internal formatting with which stems from the fact that the css has already been refine from previous parts. It is largely text.
