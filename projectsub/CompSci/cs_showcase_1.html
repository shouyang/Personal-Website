<h3> Interactive Content | 03-Feb-2016</h3>
<p>
I've decided to segment projects into three sections and a general section for fun. I thought it would add to the interactablity of the site. Come to think of it, I don't know if this could be considered dynamic content. As it currently stands the links above these posts aren't actually links but buttons formatted so that they look the same. I could do the same functionality with links however, it would be more work.

As I've said in a general post, I use AJAX and jQuery to handle these posts. Originally the projects page simply contained five jQuery fuctions which go into the file tree and find my project posts. To handle multiple categories, I don't know why, I orginally wanted to inject an html script into the appropreate web section. Now, every thing simply takes over the same area using the tools I've already learned when setting up the first projects page.
