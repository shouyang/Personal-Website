In iteratively learning more about web developement I've decided to add more modularization and interactive elements to the site. I've gone with the general schema of putting my posts loosely into the bins of general stuff, computing science, finance , and military science. Come to think of it, these are light categories of posts.

I've already made a post in the computing science section talking about making all this happen! Going forwards, I might look into making cross section posting a thing. At the moment I would prefer avoiding learning a ton of new subjects at a very shallow level. I'd imagine php would be needed for a lot more stuff.
