I guess this will be the very first post for the finance section. You probably know what will be posted here.

At the time being, I'm focusing on getting the site started and doing all this web dev stuff. I encourage you to check the Lululemon DCF model and report in the documents section. Thinking back to that, there are a lot of changes I would make to the model with my current experience. I made the report and model over the summer of 2015.
