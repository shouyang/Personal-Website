<h3> Lululemon Valuation | 03-Apr-2016</h3>
<p>
Let's make some more project articles. The following was the Discounted Cash Flow Model I made during the Summer of 2015. There's quite a few adjustments I would make if i were to do the analysis today however I feel confortable leaving it as it is for people to see. Take a look at the following report plus model if you'd like. The main changes I would make would be stuff into the WACC assumptions.
