			Click above to go to my YouTube Channel! This page serves as a landing for my proprietorship. To this, I suppose this demonstrates some of my skills in the related multimedia areas such as video and image editing. Overall I wanted to test importing a video player here on my site. The above should update as I publish more videos always embeding the lastest video.

			I made my channel in 2011. Originally I did so because I wanted to cover some niche titles on military history / military science. I absolutely love strategy games. At the time, I didn't have a way to buy these titles and would preview some titles through the form of Youtube videos. Since this was a niche genre out of which featured an even smaller field of video makers/uploaders it was often difficult to do so. Often products in this area are quite expensive too given the limited audience and the need for extensive research. So to all this, I decided to make videos shortly after building a custom PC for myself. Up to that point I didn't have the computing power to do so.

			Currently my channel is monitized under Curse Inc. I am a network partner with them. Usually people have no idea who Curse Inc. is, the simple answer is simply the Minecraft Wiki people. They run various other services. Frankly a side effect of their hands-off approach leads me to no idea what else they do. I think they also run some popluar sites such as a guides site for League of Legends.

			I suppose it would be natural for me to talk about my video workflow. Originally I used FRAPS for recording of my videos. FRAPS, in simple terms, creates high quality lossless video which takes a lot of space. From this, I would encode my videos to a smaller size through a mixture of MeGUI and avisynth. From what I remember at the time, MeGUI is a open source video encoder that takes an avisynth file and converts a video editing script into a video .avi file. While this worked, I felt rather limited by the fact that I had no programming experience at the time which made any editing outside of simple video join actions quite difficult. That and Canadian bandwidth severely limited the bitrate or video quality of my videos. Since then I now use Bandicam for recording and Sony Vegas to edit then encode my videos. Overall I am very happy with Bandicam, the primary added benefit is that it either encodes videos as it records or simply doesn't enable lossless footage recording unless specified. The added benefit is workflow time. On average to encode something takes me about 1.5x - 2x the time to record a video. Following that it may take up to 3x the time to upload a video. As for editing and encoding, Sony Vegas supports fully featured GUI and drag and drop capacity making editing a very straight forward process for common and uncommon effects. Recently I've been experimenting with online streaming. I'm actually very suprised that my Canadian connection can support a high enough upload speed for decent 1080p footage. To this, I am using Open Broadcaster Software. This supports a large amount of plugins and other various in stream additions. I was originally turned off by the fact that most of the functionaility comes from an in-video internet browser. Of-course now, after designing this site, I should have a better grasp as to how to modify the browser to suit my needs.
